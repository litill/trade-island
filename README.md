This is a work in progress of the **"PURPLE - Backend Developer Test"**.

My intention was that, even if the whole app cannot be finished on time ( wasn't sure about the deadline ), I could show you something meaningful. So, for this work-in-progress, here are what i consiedered the fundaments of such an APP.

Since I was asked today to clean up a bit and prepare the repo for your check, I dropped developing the functionality and started creating a draft of the WP-REST subsystem of this plugin.

Thank you for giving me a chance to try.

Swagger documentation
---------------------

Please excuse this crude draft, there's nothing much to it right now:

https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/polcode5/sage-discover_lando_api/5.9.2#/

The app runs now in my local lando container.

Installation
------------

Please pull this repo into `wp-content/plugins/trade-island` folder

Note: the plugin requires `PHP 7.4`
