This is a work in progress of the **"PURPLE - Backend Developer Test"**.

My intention was that, even if the whole app cannot be finished on time ( wasn't sure about the deadline ), I could show you something meaningful. So, for this work-in-progress, here are what i consiedered the fundaments of such an APP.

Since I was asked today to clean up a bit and prepare the repo for your check, I dropped developing the functionality and started creating a draft of the WP-REST subsystem of this plugin.

Thank you for giving me a chance to try.
